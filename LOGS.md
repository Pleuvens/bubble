- Project setup and deployed on Coolify
- Fetching recent tweets from Twitter API

### TODO

- Currently fetching from one user, need to implement fetching from multiple users (build query like `from:username1 OR from:username2`)
- start time should be specified or default to 24 hours ago
- Set twitter API key in runtime environment
